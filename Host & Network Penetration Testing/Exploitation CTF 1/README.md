Two Linux machines are accessible at target1.ine.local and target2.ine.local. Identify the application and service running on these machines, and capture the flags. The flag is an md5 hash format.

Flag 1: Identify and exploit the vulnerable web application running on target1.ine.local and retrieve the flag from the root directory. The credentials admin:password1 may be useful.

Flag 2: Further, identify and compromise an insecure system user on target1.ine.local.

Flag 3: Identify and exploit the vulnerable plugin used by the web application running on target2.ine.local and retrieve the flag3.txt file from the root directory.

Flag 4: Further, identify and compromise a system user requiring no authentication on target2.ine.local.

The following wordlists will be useful:

/usr/share/nmap/nselib/data/wp-plugins.lst

/usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt

Tools:

Nmap,
Hydra,
Dirb,
Python3,
Metasploit


## Lets start with an Nmap scan on target1.ine.local 

![img](1.png)

we found two open ports , lets perform service version detection and default script scan on them

![img](2.png)

using script http-enum to enemurate more information

![img](3.png)

![img](4.png)

in /acp found a login page

![img](5.png)

lets login with the credentials given to us 

![img](6.png)

the cms used here is flatcore , lets search for its exploit ,Lets copy the exploit to our current working directory 

![img](7.png)

Lets use that exploit with our credentials 

![img](8.png)

we cant able to switch directory with cd , so we can list the contents with ls

![img](9.png)

![img](10.png)

We found a user named iamaweakuser , we know that ssh port is open , lets use hydra to crack the password of the user over ssh

![img](11.png)

![img](12.png)

We successfully found the flag1 and flag2

## Lets start with the Namp Scan on target2.ine.local

![img](13.png)

lets perform service verson detection and defualt script scan on them

![img](14.png)

lets use gobuster to enemurate the webdirectories

![img](15.png)

![img](16.png)

![img](17.png)

We found two plugins duplicator and akismet

lets find for the exploit for this vulnerability 

![img](18.png)

There is a msf module , lets use that 

![img](19.png)

the default filepath is set to /etc/passwd , lets set the rhosts and run it 

![img](20.png)
![img](21.png)

We found a user 

now lets read the flag3.txt file --> assumption 

![img](22.png)

Flag 4: Further, identify and compromise a system user requiring no authentication on target2.ine.local.

lets login into ssh with the username we found
