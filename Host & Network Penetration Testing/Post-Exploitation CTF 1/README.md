In this lab environment, you will be provided with GUI access to a Kali Linux machine. Two machines are accessible at http://target1.ine.local and http://target2.ine.local.

Objective: Execute Post-Exploitation techniques on the target to uncover hidden flags and fully exploit the compromised environment.

Flags to Capture:

Flag 1: The file that stores user account details is worth a closer look. (target1.ine.local)

Flag 2: User groups might reveal more than you expect.

Flag 3: Scheduled tasks often have telling names. Investigate the cron jobs to uncover the secret.

Flag 4: DNS configurations might point you in the right direction. Also, explore the home directories for stored credentials.

Flag 5: Use the discovered credentials to gain higher privileges and explore the root's home directory on target2.ine.local.
